            <p>
              Education is the process of acquiring knowledge, building/developing
            the powers of reasoning and sound judgment. 
            <br />
            There are basically three types of education namely the formal, informal and the
            non-formal methods of education.
             While formal education is well
            structured, informal education is an unplanned, unstructured and
            does not follow a particular learning method. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
             The Non-formal
            education on its own is a structured vocational educational system
            which could be learning of skills, trade or programme mostly
            acquired and imparted consciously. <br />
            </p>

            The three types of education
            shapes individuals and are important to the pyramid of growth of all
            individuals. These said, for any society to grow, Education is a key
            role that shapes any community.
            <p/>
            
            <p>
            
              In Aka Ikot Udo Eno, informal and
              the non-formal education had been part of the society with a lower
              percentage of the individuals acquiring formal education to the
            tertiary level.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Efforts from the citizens to acquire formal
              education from the Primary to the Secondary levels have been
              commendable despite the lack of Secondary School in the community.
              Normally, citizens living in Aka Ikot Udo Eno, after completion of
              Primary Education, go to nearby communities to attend Secondary
              School.
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
            This therefore brought about the need for the James Udoekong
            Education Trust Fund to motivate and encourage these efforts and
            citizens of Aka Ikot Udo Eno who are passionate about furthering
            their formal education to the tertiary level but lack motivation or
            on the other hand, have limited resources to achieve this goal.
